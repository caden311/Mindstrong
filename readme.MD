# Prerequisites
- Install Node (i'm using v16.13.0)

# Building The App
Within the Mindstrong directory
- Open a terminal and run `npm run build-server`
- Open another new terminal and run `npm run build-client`

Your browser should open automatically. But if it doesn't check out **localhost:4200**.

## Notes
For the sake of time I left out the following things:
- Unit tests (normally I always test my code)
- Authentication
- Authorization
